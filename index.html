        <h1>Making a housing investment the smart way</h1>
    </div>
    <div id="'intro" class="intro">
        Making a housing investment takes a lot of starting income and the best apartments are hard to get access to. Or is it? According to our research comparing the costs and rental incomes of different cities in Finland by postal code we have found out that a lot of suburbs in different cities have surprisingly cheap prices and yet yield a great amount of rental income.

        <div class="text">When looking at the best possible areas to make an investment the results are unexpected. None of the classic central areas pop up.

        <div class="text">When comparing the different postal code areas separating them by the number of bedrooms, we can see a clear increase in rent for single bedroom apartments at the same price level as the other 2 or 3 + bedroom options. Thus a single bedroom apartment it the way to go for a housing investor </div>

        <div class="text">On the other hand, color coding the same areas by the city they are located in we can see some areas in Helsinki being extremely expensive to purchase, but still give same level rental income as other cheaper options, meaning some areas in Helsinki seem way overpriced </div>
